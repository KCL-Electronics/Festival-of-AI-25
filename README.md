# KCL-RIE Festival of AI 2025
## Project
The project for 2025 aims to develop a football game where two players each control two robots, and the AI controls the other two robots. The objective is to score goals against the opposing team.

A TV screen is used as a heads-up display, mobile phones are used as controllers and an overhead camera is connected to the server

## Code
